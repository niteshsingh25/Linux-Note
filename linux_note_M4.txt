File Permission
--------------------
->Linux is a multi-user operating system, so it has security to prevent people from accessing each other’s confidential files.

->There are three type of Permissions are:
       r – Read
      w – Write
      x – Execute
->Each Permission (rwx) can be controlled at three level:
     u – Owner
     g – Group
     o – Others
     a – All users
->The potential Assignment Operators are + (plus) and – (minus); these are used to tell the system whether to add or remove the specific permissions.

Advanced Permissions:
The special permissions flag can be marked with any of the following:
    _ – no special permissions
   d – directory
   l– The file or directory is a symbolic link
   s – This indicated the setuid/setgid permissions. This is not set displayed in the special permission part of the permissions display, but is represented as a s in the read portion of the owner or group permissions.
   t – This indicates the sticky bit permissions. This is not set displayed in the special permission part of the permissions display, but is represented as a t in the executable portion of the all users permissions.
