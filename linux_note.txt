Module 1-Understanding Linux Concepts
---------------------------------------------
Linux is used everywhere around us.
 Aeroplane,Internet Access,TV ,Websites,Smartphones,Appliances,Tabletes,Self Driving Cars,..etc.

->Linux is an Operating System which sits in the middle of your hardware and users.
->Linux is open source and mostly free.
->Linux is used by many developers community or Companies(Redhat,CentOS,Debian,Ubuntu,Suse).
->Linux can be installed on a wide veriety of computer h/w, ranging from Moblie phones,tablates,vedia games, to mainframes and supercomputers.

=======================================================================
Module 2 - Download, Install and Configure
-----------------------------------------------------------
What is Oracle VertualBox
->VirtualBox is a open source hypervisor for x86 computer currently being developed by Oracle Corporation.
->It install on your existing Intel or AMD_based computers,whether they are running Windows,Mac,Linux or solaris OS.It extends the capabilities of your existing computerso that it can run multiple OS on one h/w at the same time.
  For eg.
Hardware->OS(Windows or MAC)->Oracle VertuaBox->Linux/Windows/MAC

Oracle VirtualBox Download and Installation
----------------------------------------------------------
->Download it from google.only type Oracle VitualBox.
->Select any one from below VirtualBox plateform packages  for download as per our requirement
     ->Windows host
     ->Os X hosts (for Mac)
     ->Linux distributions
     ->Solaris hosts 
->Install the package as default setup.
->Now we are ready to use VirtualBox.

Create Virtual Machine on VirtualBox
-----------------------------------------------
->Open Virtual Box manager
     ->Click on new 
     ->Name of VM
     ->Machine Folder (Install path)
     ->Type (Linux/CentOS/ubuntu...etc)
     ->Version -windows10(64bit)  --As per our base OS
     ->Select Hard disk -createa virtual hard disk now
     ->Click on create
     ->Give file size as per requirement
     ->Select default setting for VDI(virtual disk image) and Storage on physical hard disk(Dynamically allocated)
     ->Click on create
 ->Ready to use VM

Different way to install Linux
-------------------------------------
1-CD -Boot from it and follow the instructions.
2-ISO image -Download or getit if already you have package.
                         ->Attache the ISO package to your VM hard disk and follow the instruction.
3-Network Boot - For bigger organization to install on multiple machines using NFS/Samba servers. 

Keyboard shortcut keys
-----------------------------------------------------
Ctrl+B	       Moves the cursor backward one character.
Ctrl+C	       Cancels the currently running command.
Ctrl+D	       Logs out of the current session.
Ctrl+E	       Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
Ctrl+F	      Moves the cursor forward one character.
Ctrl+H	      Erase one character. Similar to pressing backspace.
Ctrl+P	      Paste previous line(s).
Ctrl+R	      Allows you to search for a previously used command or switch.
Ctrl+S	      Stops all output on-screen (XOFF).
Ctrl+Q	      Turns all output stopped on-screen back on (XON). Also, closes an application window.
Ctrl+U	      Erases the complete line.
Ctrl+W	      Deletes the last word typed. For example, if you typed mv file1 file2, this shortcut would delete file2.
Ctrl+Z	      Cancels the current operation, moves back a directory or takes the current operation and moves it to  the background. See bg command for additional information about background.
Ctrl+Alt+D ---Minimizes all application windows and shows the desktop.
Ctrl+Alt+L ---Locks the screen.
Ctrl+Alt+T ---Opens a new terminal window.
Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down arrow ---Switches between workspaces (if you are a power user and use workspaces).
Alt+F2	   --Open the console to run a command (must be a power user).
Arrow Up/Down ---Scroll through previously used commands.

 ~	Moves to the user's home directory.
!!	Repeats the line last entered at the shell.
!$	Repeats the last argument for the command last used. See history command for previous commands.
reset	Resets the terminal if the terminal screen is not displaying correctly.
shutdown -h now	Remotely or locally shuts the system down.
====================================================
RedHat Vs CentOS
--------------------------------
Product release: Where the RHEL initially released in 13th May 1995 and considered as a few original old Linux destroy, the CentOS is based on RHEL code itself. The CentOS first came into the market on 14th May 2004.

Pricing: The CentOS is free to use. But for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you need to purchase a paid license.

Performance focus: Because the RHEL or Red Hat Enterprise Linux is older, so it supports many platform and freeware. But the RHEL focus is to make a stable system. Likewise, the CentOS also focus on stability, but it misses deep intermigration by the coder and user.

Users: Consequently, the RHEL is used by many important platforms, data centers, servers, etc. The CentOS is used by less critical business platforms, due to its non-official or public support groups.

Support: Lastly, the CentOS is supported by its community or it’s community driven support. If a bug comes or beta version of CentOS comes, they try and make it perfectly workable. But the RHEL is supported by their closed developers- ‘Red Hat’ itself. There are few open communities are present for RHEL but the hard work for any problem solving is performed by the ‘Team Red Hat’.

->Redhat is the corporate version based on the progress of that project, and it has slower releases, comes with support, and isn’t free.
->CentOS is basically the community version of Redhat. So it’s pretty much identical, but it is free and support comes from the community as opposed to Redhat itself.

================================================================
Module 3 - System Access and File System
------------------------------------------------------
[root@hostname ~]#-Prompt symbol
============================================
Same optput will all below cmds:
#ip a
#ip addr
#ifconfig 
If "ifconfig" cmd does not work then typr "ip a".
ifconfig is replavced by ip cmd in newer version of Linux.
===============================================================
Host-only Adapter= Aloow communication between your PC and the VM.
Bridged Adapter=Allow communication between your pC and VM plus allows communication to the internet.
->If network adopter is not up then follow as below:
#Sudo su -
#ifup enp0s3 (adoptername)
#ifconfig  -Check status

====================================
Imp Things to remember
-----------------------
Linux has a super administrator account "root".
"root" is the most powerfull account that can create, modify,delete account and make change to system configuration files.
Linux is case-sessitive system.
Avoid using file names with space.

=========================================
