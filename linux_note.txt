Module 1-Understanding Linux Concepts
---------------------------------------------
Linux is used everywhere around us.
 Aeroplane,Internet Access,TV ,Websites,Smartphones,Appliances,Tabletes,Self Driving Cars,..etc.

->Linux is an Operating System which sits in the middle of your hardware and users.
->Linux is open source and mostly free.
->Linux is used by many developers community or Companies(Redhat,CentOS,Debian,Ubuntu,Suse).
->Linux can be installed on a wide veriety of computer h/w, ranging from Moblie phones,tablates,vedia games, to mainframes and supercomputers.

=======================================================================
Module 2 - Download, Install and Configure
-----------------------------------------------------------
What is Oracle VertualBox
->VirtualBox is a open source hypervisor for x86 computer currently being developed by Oracle Corporation.
->It install on your existing Intel or AMD_based computers,whether they are running Windows,Mac,Linux or solaris OS.It extends the capabilities of your existing computerso that it can run multiple OS on one h/w at the same time.
  For eg.
Hardware->OS(Windows or MAC)->Oracle VertuaBox->Linux/Windows/MAC

Oracle VirtualBox Download and Installation
----------------------------------------------------------
->Download it from google.only type Oracle VitualBox.
->Select any one from below VirtualBox plateform packages  for download as per our requirement
     ->Windows host
     ->Os X hosts (for Mac)
     ->Linux distributions
     ->Solaris hosts 
->Install the package as default setup.
->Now we are ready to use VirtualBox.

Create Virtual Machine on VirtualBox
-----------------------------------------------
->Open Virtual Box manager
     ->Click on new 
     ->Name of VM
     ->Machine Folder (Install path)
     ->Type (Linux/CentOS/ubuntu...etc)
     ->Version -windows10(64bit)  --As per our base OS
     ->Select Hard disk -createa virtual hard disk now
     ->Click on create
     ->Give file size as per requirement
     ->Select default setting for VDI(virtual disk image) and Storage on physical hard disk(Dynamically allocated)
     ->Click on create
 ->Ready to use VM

Different way to install Linux
-------------------------------------
1-CD -Boot from it and follow the instructions.
2-ISO image -Download or getit if already you have package.
                         ->Attache the ISO package to your VM hard disk and follow the instruction.
3-Network Boot - For bigger organization to install on multiple machines using NFS/Samba servers. 

Keyboard shortcut keys
-----------------------------------------------------
Ctrl+B	       Moves the cursor backward one character.
Ctrl+C	       Cancels the currently running command.
Ctrl+D	       Logs out of the current session.
Ctrl+E	       Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
Ctrl+F	      Moves the cursor forward one character.
Ctrl+H	      Erase one character. Similar to pressing backspace.
Ctrl+P	      Paste previous line(s).
Ctrl+R	      Allows you to search for a previously used command or switch.
Ctrl+S	      Stops all output on-screen (XOFF).
Ctrl+Q	      Turns all output stopped on-screen back on (XON). Also, closes an application window.
Ctrl+U	      Erases the complete line.
Ctrl+W	      Deletes the last word typed. For example, if you typed mv file1 file2, this shortcut would delete file2.
Ctrl+Z	      Cancels the current operation, moves back a directory or takes the current operation and moves it to  the background. See bg command for additional information about background.

!!	Repeats the line last entered at the shell.
!$	Repeats the last argument for the command last used. See history command for previous commands.
reset	Resets the terminal if the terminal screen is not displaying correctly.
shutdown -h now	Remotely or locally shuts the system down.
====================================================
RedHat Vs CentOS
--------------------------------
Product release: Where the RHEL initially released in 13th May 1995 and considered as a few original old Linux destroy, the CentOS is based on RHEL code itself. The CentOS first came into the market on 14th May 2004.

Pricing: The CentOS is free to use. But for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you need to purchase a paid license.

Performance focus: Because the RHEL or Red Hat Enterprise Linux is older, so it supports many platform and freeware. But the RHEL focus is to make a stable system. Likewise, the CentOS also focus on stability, but it misses deep intermigration by the coder and user.

Users: Consequently, the RHEL is used by many important platforms, data centers, servers, etc. The CentOS is used by less critical business platforms, due to its non-official or public support groups.

Support: Lastly, the CentOS is supported by its community or it’s community driven support. If a bug comes or beta version of CentOS comes, they try and make it perfectly workable. But the RHEL is supported by their closed developers- ‘Red Hat’ itself. There are few open communities are present for RHEL but the hard work for any problem solving is performed by the ‘Team Red Hat’.

->Redhat is the corporate version based on the progress of that project, and it has slower releases, comes with support, and isn’t free.
->CentOS is basically the community version of Redhat. So it’s pretty much identical, but it is free and support comes from the community as opposed to Redhat itself.

================================================================
Module 3 - System Access and File System
------------------------------------------------------
[root@hostname ~]#-Prompt symbol
============================================
Same optput will all below cmds:
#ip a
#ip addr
#ifconfig 
If "ifconfig" cmd does not work then typr "ip a".
ifconfig is replavced by ip cmd in newer version of Linux.
===============================================================
Host-only Adapter= Aloow communication between your PC and the VM.
Bridged Adapter=Allow communication between your pC and VM plus allows communication to the internet.
->If network adopter is not up then follow as below:
#Sudo su -
#ifup enp0s3 (adoptername)
#ifconfig  -Check status

====================================
Imp Things to remember
-----------------------
Linux has a super administrator account "root".
"root" is the most powerfull account that can create, modify,delete account and make change to system configuration files.
Linux is case-sessitive system.
Avoid using file names with space.

=========================================
File System Structure and its Description
---------------------------------------------------
/boot                    -Contain file that is used by the boot loader(grub.cfg)
/root                     -root user home directory.It is not same as / .
/dev                      -System devices(e.g. cdrom,speaker,flashdrive,keyboard etc.)
/etc                       -Configuration files(e.g. ntfs,nfs etc.)
/bin ->/usr/bin   -Everyday user commands(e.g. "ps -ef", "top"  etc.)
/sbin ->/usr/bin -System/filesystem commands(e.g. any configuration change  commands)
/opt                      -Optinal add_on application(Not part of OS apps / thirs pary installation path like "Oracle, Commvault, etc.")
/proc                    -Running processes (Ony exist in memory)
/lib ->usr/bin      -C programming library files needed by commands and appps(e.g. pwd,ls  etc.)
/tmp                    -Directory for temporary files
/home                -Directory for user
/var                     -System logs
/mnt                    -To  mount external filesystem (e.g. NFS)
/media                -For cdrom mounts.
================================================
File System Navigation Commands (cd , ls and pwd)

File System Paths
----------------------
There are two paths to navigate to a filesytem:
1-Absolute Pah
2-Relative Path

->An Absolute path does not begin a "/" . This indicates that path starts at root directory.
     e.g. 
    #cd /var/log/samba
->A relative path does not start with a "/" . It dentifies a location relative to your current position.
    e.g.
    # cd /var
    # cd log
    #cd samba

================================================
Linux File System
-------------------------
-       -Regular file
d     - Directory
l      - link
c      -Special file or device file (any thing which we have attached with machine like keyboard,cpu,memory will create a file also)
s    - Socket
p    -Named pipe
b   -Block device
===========================================
Find file and directories
-------------------------------
Two main cmds are used to find file/directories
. find
.locate

for e.g
#find .-name "filename"     ("." mean in this sysntex is current directories) 
#locate filename  (it will show complete path with same result as find cmds)

->If "locate" cmd does not output any result then rootrun:
#updatedb  (Run it as a root user)
->Also make sure you have mlocate package installed. To install package as root run:
#yum install mlocate"
 
Difference b/w locate & find cmd
------------------------------------------
 ->locate used prebuilt database which should be regularly updated, while "find" cmd iterates over filesystem to locate file .Thus, locate is much faster than find, but can be inaccurate if the database (can beseen as a cache) is not upadted.Its mean if DB is upadted then "locate" cmd faster but if DB isn't updated then it can give inaccurate output.
->To update DB run "updatedb" (If you don't want to run this cmd system runs this cms at regular time of interval)
#updatedb  (run it as root user)
==================================
Wildcard
--------------
\      =(slash  -"as an escape charecter")
^    =(caret   -"the begining of the line")
$  =(dollar sign  -"the end of the line")
*   -Represents zero or more charecters
?   -Represents a single charecter
[] -Represent range of charecter
For e.g.
# touch abc{1...9}-xyg  (It will create 9 files as "abc1-xyg ,abc2-xyg .....abc9-xyg ")

#mkdir {a..c}{1..3}    (It will create 9 directories}

Soft link and Hard link
------------------------------------
->inode =Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
->Soft Link  =Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed
->Hard Link   =Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link.
ln        -hard link
ln -s    -soft link

->In soft link if source file is deleted then the link is broken but in hard link deleting a source file will not impact the linked file.
