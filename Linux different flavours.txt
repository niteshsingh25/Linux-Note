RedHat Vs CentOS
--------------------------------
Product release: Where the RHEL initially released in 13th May 1995 and considered as a few original old Linux destroy, the CentOS is based on RHEL code itself. The CentOS first came into the market on 14th May 2004.

Pricing: The CentOS is free to use. But for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you need to purchase a paid license.

Performance focus: Because the RHEL or Red Hat Enterprise Linux is older, so it supports many platform and freeware. But the RHEL focus is to make a stable system. Likewise, the CentOS also focus on stability, but it misses deep intermigration by the coder and user.

Users: Consequently, the RHEL is used by many important platforms, data centers, servers, etc. The CentOS is used by less critical business platforms, due to its non-official or public support groups.

Support: Lastly, the CentOS is supported by its community or it’s community driven support. If a bug comes or beta version of CentOS comes, they try and make it perfectly workable. But the RHEL is supported by their closed developers- ‘Red Hat’ itself. There are few open communities are present for RHEL but the hard work for any problem solving is performed by the ‘Team Red Hat’.

->Redhat is the corporate version based on the progress of that project, and it has slower releases, comes with support, and isn’t free.
->CentOS is basically the community version of Redhat. So it’s pretty much identical, but it is free and support comes from the community as opposed to Redhat itself.
